  <p>This document covers network-level security. For documentation on the
authentication and authorization features introduced in Riak 2.0, see

</blockquote>

<p>This article discusses standard configurations and port settings to use
when providing network security for a Riak Cluster. There are two
classes of access control for Riak:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Other Riak nodes participating in the cluster</li>
  <li>Clients making use of the Riak cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>The settings for both access groups are located in your cluster’s
configuration settings. If you are using the newer configuration system,
you can set a host and port for each node in that node’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak.conf</code>
file, setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener.protobuf</code> if you are using Riak’s Protocol
Buffers interface or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener.http</code> if you are using HTTP (or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener.https</code> if you are using SSL). If you are using the older
configuration system, adjust the settings of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code>,
depending on which client interface you are using.</p>

<p>Make note of these configurations and set up your firewall to allow
incoming TCP access to those ports or IP address/port combinations.
Exceptions to this are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handoff_ip</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handoff_port</code> directives.
Those are for communication between Riak nodes only.</p>

<h2 id="inter-node-communication">Inter-node Communication</h2>

<p>Riak uses the Erlang distribution mechanism for most inter-node
communication. Riak identifies other machines in the ring using Erlang
identifiers (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;hostname or IP&gt;</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak@10.9.8.7</code>). Erlang resolves
these node identifiers to a TCP port on a given machine via the Erlang
Port Mapper daemon (epmd) running on each cluster node.</p>

<p>By default, epmd binds to TCP port 4369 and listens on the wildcard
interface. For inter-node communication, Erlang uses an unpredictable
port by default; it binds to port 0, which means the first available
port.</p>

<p>For ease of firewall configuration, Riak can be configured
to instruct the Erlang interpreter to use a limited range
of ports. For example, to restrict the range of ports that Erlang will
use for inter-Erlang node communication to 6000-7999, add the following
lines to the configuration file on each Riak node:</p>

<pre><code class="language-riakconf">erlang.distribution.port_range.minimum = 6000
erlang.distribution.port_range.maximum = 7999
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-appconfig">{ kernel, [
            {inet_dist_listen_min, 6000},
            {inet_dist_listen_max, 7999}
          ]},
</code></pre>

<p>The above lines should be added into the top level list in app.config,
at the same level as all the other applications (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak_core</code>).
Then configure your firewall to allow incoming access to TCP ports 6000
through 7999 from whichever network(s) contain your Riak nodes.</p>

<h3 id="riak-node-ports">Riak Node Ports</h3>

<p>Riak nodes in a cluster need to be able to communicate freely with one
another on the following ports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>epmd listener: TCP:4369</li>
  <li>handoff_port listener: TCP:8099</li>
  <li>range of ports specified in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.config</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak.conf</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="riak-client-ports">Riak Client Ports</h3>

<p>Riak clients must be able to contact at least one machine in a Riak
cluster on the following TCP ports:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Protocol</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Port</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/developing/api/http/">HTTP</a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">TCP port 8098</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/developing/api/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffers</a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">TCP port 8087</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="riak-search-ports">Riak Search Ports</h3>

<p>Riak’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/developing/usage/search">search</a> feature relies on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>, which runs
on each Riak node if security has been <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/search/#enabling-riak-search">enabled</a>. When
Riak’s Search subsystem starts up, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html">JMX</a> opens a well-known port as well
as some ephemeral ports. The well-known port is determined by the value of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search.solr.jmx_port</code> in each node’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/reference/#search">Search configuration</a>.
The default is 8985.</p>

<p>In addition to JMX ports, Solr also binds to a well-known port of its
own, as determined by each node’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search.solr.port</code> setting, which is
also located in each node’s Search configuration. The default is 8093.</p>

<h1 id="riak-security-community">Riak Security Community</h1>

<h2 id="riak">Riak</h2>

<p>Riak is a powerful open-source distributed database focused on scaling
predictably and easily, while remaining highly available in the face of
server crashes, network partitions or other (inevitable) disasters.</p>

<h2 id="commitment">Commitment</h2>

<p>Data security is an important and sensitive issue to many of our users.
A real-world approach to security allows us to balance appropriate
levels of security and related overhead while creating a fast, scalable,
and operationally straightforward database.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h3>

<p>Though we make every effort to thwart security vulnerabilities whenever
possible (including through independent reviews), no system is
completely secure. We will never claim that Riak is 100% secure (and you
should seriously doubt anyone who claims their solution is). What we can
promise is that we openly accept all vulnerabilities from the community.
When appropriate, we’ll publish and make every attempt to quickly
address these concerns.</p>

<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>

<p>More layers of security increase operational and administrative costs.
Sometimes those costs are warranted, sometimes they are not. Our
approach is to strike an appropriate balance between effort, cost, and
security.</p>

<p>For example, Riak does not have fine-grained role-base security. Though
it can be an attractive bullet-point in a database comparison chart,
you’re usually better off finely controlling data access through your
application or a service layer.</p>

<h3 id="notifying-basho">Notifying Basho</h3>

<p>If you discover a potential security issue, please email us at
<strong>security@basho.com</strong>, and allow us 48 hours to reply.</p>

<p>We prefer to be contacted first, rather than searching for blog posts
over the Internet. This allows us to open a dialogue with the security
community on how best to handle a possible exploit without putting any
users at risk.</p>

<h2 id="security-best-practices">Security Best Practices</h2>

<h3 id="authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<p>For instructions on how to apply permissions and to require client
authentication, please see our documentation on <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/using/security/basics">Riak Security</a>.</p>

<h3 id="network-configurations">Network Configurations</h3>

<p>Being a distributed database means that much of Riak’s security springs
from how you configure your network. We have a few recommendations for
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/using/security/basics">Security and Firewalls</a>.</p>

<h3 id="client-auth">Client Auth</h3>

<p>All of the Riak client libraries support encrypted TCP communication
as well as authentication and authorization. For instructions on how
to apply permissions and to require client authentication, please see
our documentation on [Riak Security] <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/using/security/basics">Riak Security</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multi-datacenter-replication">Multi-Datacenter Replication</h3>

<p>For those versions of Riak that support Multi Data Center (MDC)
Replication, you can configure Riak 1.2+ to communicate over SSL, to
seamlessly encrypt the message traffic.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/v3-multi-datacenter/ssl">Multi Data Center Replication: SSL</a> in the Enterprise
Documentation.</p>
