  <p><strong>Note: Technical preview</strong></p>

  <p>The active anti-entropy fullsync strategy, as it pertains to
replication, is currently in <strong>technical preview</strong> mode. This means that
it hasn’t been tested at large scale and that there may be issues that
Basho must address prior to a general release. Please don’t use this
feature on a production system without professional services or customer
service engineering support.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Riak Enterprise Multi-Datacenter (MDC) Replication version 3 (Riak
Enterprise version 1.4.0+) can now take advantage of Riak’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/glossary/#active-anti-entropy-aae">active anti-entropy</a> (AAE) subsystem, which was first introduced as a
technology preview in Riak 1.3.0.</p>

<p>AAE plus Replication uses existing Riak AAE hash trees stored in
LevelDB, so if AAE is already active, there is no additional startup
delay for enabling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aae</code> fullsync strategy. AAE can also be enabled
for the first time on a cluster, although some custom settings can
enhance performance in this case to help AAE trees be built more
quickly. See <a href="#aae-tree-build-optimization">Configuration/AAE Tree Build Optimization</a>.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Riak Enterprise version 1.4.0 or later installed on source and sink
clusters</li>
  <li>Riak Enterprise MDC Replication Version 3 enabled on source and sink
clusters</li>
  <li>Both source and sink clusters must be of the same ring size</li>
  <li>AAE must be enabled on both source and sink clusters</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fullsync_strategy</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak_repl</code> section of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advanced.config</code> configuration file must be set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aae</code> on both
source and sink clusters</li>
  <li>AAE trees must have been built on both source and sink clusters. In
the event that an AAE tree is not built on both the source and sink,
fullsync will default to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keylisting</code> fullsync strategy for that
partition.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>If you are using Riak Enterprise version 2.0, configuration is managed
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advanced.config</code> files on
each node. The semantics of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advanced.config</code> file are similar to
the formerly used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.config</code> file. For more information and for a list
of configurable parameters, see our documentation on <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/reference/#advanced-configuration">Advanced Configuration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="enable-active-anti-entropy">Enable Active Anti-Entropy</h2>

<p>To enable <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/glossary/#active-anti-entropy-aae">active anti-entropy</a> (AAE) in Riak Enterprise, you must enable it in Riak in both source and sink clusters. If it is not
enabled, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keylist</code> strategy will be used.</p>

<p>To enable AAE in Riak KV:</p>

<pre><code class="language-riakconf">anti_entropy = active
</code></pre>

<p>By default, it could take a couple of days for the cluster to build all
of the necessary hash trees because the default <strong>build rate</strong> of trees
is to build 1 partition per hour, per node. With a
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/concepts/clusters">ring size</a> of 256 and 5 nodes, that is 2 days.</p>

<p>Changing the rate of tree building can speed up this process, with the
caveat that rebuilding a tree takes processing time from the cluster,
and this should not be done without assessing the possible impact on
get/put latencies for normal cluster operations. For a production
cluster, we recommend leaving the default in place.</p>

<p>For a test cluster, the build rate can be changed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak.conf</code>. If a
partition has not had its AAE tree built yet, it will default to using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keylist</code> replication strategy. Instructions on these settings can
be found in the section directly below.</p>

<div id="aae-tree-build-optimization"></div>

<h3 id="aae-tree-build-optimization">AAE Tree Build Optimization</h3>

<p>You can speed up the build rate for AAE-related hash trees by adjusting
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anti_entropy.tree.build_limit.*</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anti_entropy.concurrency_limit</code>
settings.</p>

<pre><code class="language-riakconf">anti_entropy.tree.build_limit.number = 10
anti_entropy.tree.build_limit.per_timespan = 1h
anti_entropy.concurrency_limit = 10
</code></pre>

<h3 id="enable-aae-fullsync-replication-strategy">Enable AAE Fullsync Replication Strategy</h3>

<p>Finally, the replication fullsync strategy must be set to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aae</code> on
both source and sink clusters. If not, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keylist</code> replication
strategy will be used.</p>

<p>To enable AAE w/ Version 3 MDC Replication:</p>

<pre><code class="language-advancedconfig">{riak_repl, [
             % ...
             {fullsync_strategy, aae},
             % ...
            ]}
</code></pre>
