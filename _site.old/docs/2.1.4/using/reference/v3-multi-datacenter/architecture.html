<p>In Multi-Datacenter (MDC) Replication, a cluster can act as either the</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>source cluster</strong>, which sends replication data to one or</li>
  <li><strong>sink clusters</strong>, which are generally located in datacenters in other
regions or countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bidirectional replication can easily be established by making a cluster
both a source and sink to other clusters. Riak Enterprise
Multi-Datacenter Replication is considered “masterless” in that all
clusters participating will resolve replicated writes via the normal
resolution methods available in Riak.</p>

<p>In Multi-Datacenter Replication, there are two primary modes of
operation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fullsync</strong> replication is a complete synchronization that occurs
between source and sink cluster(s), which can be performed upon
initial connection of a sink cluster if you wish</li>
  <li><strong>Realtime</strong> replication is a continual, incremental synchronization
triggered by successful writing of new updates on the source cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>Fullsync and realtime replication modes are described in detail below.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>A source refers to a cluster that is the primary producer of replication
data. A source can also refer to any node that is part of the source
cluster. Source clusters push data to sink clusters.</p>

<h3 id="sinks">Sinks</h3>

<p>A sink refers to a cluster that is the primary consumer of replication
data. A sink can also refer to any node that is part of the sink
cluster. Sink clusters receive data from source clusters.</p>

<h3 id="cluster-manager">Cluster Manager</h3>

<p>The cluster manager is a Riak Enterprise service that provides
information regarding nodes and protocols supported by the sink and
source clusters. This information is primarily consumed by the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl connect</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="fullsync-coordinator">Fullsync Coordinator</h3>

<p>In fullsync replication, a node on the source cluster is elected to be
the <em>fullsync coordinator</em>. This node is responsible for starting and
stopping replication to the sink cluster. It also communicates with the
sink cluster to exchange key lists and ultimately transfer data across a
TCP connection. If a fullsync coordinator is terminated as the result of
an error, it will automatically restart on the current node. If the node
becomes unresponsive, a leader election will take place within 5 seconds
to select a new node from the cluster to become the coordinator. In the
event of a coordinator restart, a fullsync will have to restart.</p>

<h2 id="fullsync-replication">Fullsync Replication</h2>

<p>Fullsync replication scans through the list of partitions in a Riak
cluster and determines which objects in the sink cluster need to be
updated. A source partition is synchronized to a node on the sink
cluster containing the current partition.</p>

<h2 id="realtime-replication">Realtime Replication</h2>

<p>In realtime replication, a node in the source cluster will forward data
to the sink cluster. A node in the source cluster does not necessarily
connect to a node containing the same <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/glossary/#vnode">vnode</a> on
the sink cluster. This allows Riak to spread out realtime replication
across the entire cluster, thus improving throughput and making
replication more fault tolerant.</p>

<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>

<p>Before a source cluster can begin pushing realtime updates to a sink,
the following commands must be issued:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl realtime enable &lt;sink_cluster&gt;</code></p>

    <p>After this command, the realtime queues (one for each Riak node) are
 populated with updates to the source cluster, ready to be pushed to
 the sink.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl realtime start &lt;sink_cluster&gt;</code></p>

    <p>This instructs the Riak connection manager to contact the sink
 cluster.</p>

    <p><br />

 <br /></p>

    <p>At this point realtime replication commences.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Nodes with queued updates establish connections to the sink cluster
and replication begins.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/images/MDC-v3-realtime2.png" alt="MDC fullsync" />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="realtime-queueing-and-synchronization">Realtime queueing and synchronization</h3>

<p>Once initialized, realtime replication continues to use the queues to
store data updates for synchronization.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>The client sends an object to store on the source cluster.</li>
<li>Riak writes N replicas on the source cluster.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/images/MDC-v3-realtime3.png" alt="MDC fullsync" />
<br /></p>

<ol start="6">
<li>The new object is stored in the realtime queue.</li>
<li>The object is copied to the sink cluster.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/images/MDC-v3-realtime4.png" alt="MDC fullsync" />
<br /></p>

<ol start="8">
<li>The destination node on the sink cluster writes the object to N
nodes.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/images/MDC-v3-realtime5.png" alt="MDC fullsync" />
<br /></p>

<ol start="9">
<li>The successful write of the object to the sink cluster is
acknowledged and the object removed from the realtime queue.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="/images/MDC-v3-realtime6.png" alt="MDC fullsync" />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>

<p>It is important to note that both clusters must have certain attributes
in common for Multi-Datacenter Replication to work. If you are using
either fullsync or realtime replication, both clusters must have the
same <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/concepts/clusters">ring size</a>; if you are using fullsync
replication, every bucket’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n_val</code> must be the same in both the
source and sink cluster.</p>
