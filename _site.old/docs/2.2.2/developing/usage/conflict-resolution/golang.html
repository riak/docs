<p>For reasons explained in the <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/conflict-resolution">Introduction to conflict resolution</a>, we strongly recommend adopting a conflict resolution strategy that
requires applications to resolve siblings according to usecase-specific
criteria. Here, weâ€™ll provide a brief guide to conflict resolution using the
official <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak-go-client">Riak Go client</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-go-client-handles-conflict-resolution">How the Go Client Handles Conflict Resolution</h2>

<p>In the Riak Go client, it is possible that the result of a fetch will return an array
of sibling objects. If there are no siblings, that property will return an
array with one value in it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basho/riak-go-client/blob/master/examples/dev/using/conflict-resolution/main.go#L68-L70"><em>Example:</em> creating object with siblings</a></p>

<p>So what happens if the length of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Values</code> is greater than 1, as in the case
above?</p>

<p>In order to resolve siblings, you need to either: fetch, update, and store a
canonical value; or choose a sibling from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Values</code> slice and store that as
the canonical value.</p>

<h2 id="basic-conflict-resolution-example">Basic Conflict Resolution Example</h2>

<p>In this example, you will ignore the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Values</code> slice and will
fetch, update and store the definitive value.</p>

<p>This example shows a basic sibling resolution strategy in which the first
sibling is chosen as the canonical value.</p>

<p>This example shows a basic sibling resolution strategy in which the first
sibling is chosen as the canonical value via a conflict resolution type.</p>
