<p>In Riak KV, MapReduce is the primary method for non-primary-key-based
querying. Although useful for tasks such as batch
processing jobs, MapReduce operations can be very computationally
expensive to the extent that they can degrade performance in
production clusters operating under load. Thus, we recommend running
MapReduce operations in a controlled, rate-limited fashion and never for
realtime querying purposes.</p>

<p>MapReduce (M/R) is a technique for dividing data processing work across
a distributed system. It takes advantage of the parallel processing
power of distributed systems and also reduces network bandwidth, as the
algorithm is passed around to where the data lives rather than
transferring a potentially huge dataset to a client algorithm.</p>

<p>You can use MapReduce for things like: filtering documents by
tags, counting words in documents, and extracting links to related data.
In Riak KV, MapReduce is one method for querying that is not strictly based
on key querying, alongside <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary indexes</a>
and <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/search">search</a>. MapReduce jobs can be submitted through the
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/api/http">HTTP API</a> or the <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/api/protocol-buffers">Protocol Buffers API</a>, although we
strongly recommend using the Protocol Buffers API for performance
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Map phases execute in parallel with data locality.</li>
  <li>Reduce phases execute in parallel on the node where the job was
submitted.</li>
  <li>MapReduce queries written in Erlang.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-to-use-mapreduce">When to Use MapReduce</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When you know the set of objects over which you want to MapReduce
(i.e. the locations of the objects, as specified by <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/bucket-types">bucket type</a>, bucket, and key)</li>
  <li>When you want to return actual objects or pieces of objects and not
just the keys. <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/search">Search</a> and <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary indexes</a> are other means of returning objects based on
non-key-based queries, but they only return lists of keys and not
whole objects.</li>
  <li>When you need the utmost flexibility in querying your data. MapReduce
gives you full access to your object and lets you pick it apart any
way you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-mapreduce">When Not to Use MapReduce</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When you want to query data over an entire bucket. MapReduce uses a
list of keys, which can place a lot of demand on the cluster.</li>
  <li>When you want latency to be as predictable as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>The MapReduce framework helps developers divide a query into steps,
divide the dataset into chunks, and then run those step/chunk pairs in
separate physical hosts.</p>

<p>There are two steps in a MapReduce query:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Map</strong> — The data collection phase, which breaks up large chunks of
work into smaller ones and then takes action on each chunk. Map
phases consist of a function and a list of objects on which the map
operation will operate.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce</strong> — The data collation or processing phase, which combines
the results from the map step into a single output. The reduce phase
is optional.</li>
</ul>

<p>Riak KV MapReduce queries have two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list of inputs</li>
  <li>A list of phases</li>
</ul>

<p>The elements of the input list are object locations as specified by
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/bucket-types">bucket type</a>, bucket, and key. The elements of the
phases list are chunks of information related to a map, a reduce, or a
link function.</p>

<p>A MapReduce query begins when a client makes the request to Riak KV. The
node that the client contacts to make the request becomes the
<em>coordinating node</em> responsible for the MapReduce job. As described
above, each job consists of a list of phases, where each phase is either
a map or a reduce phase. The coordinating node uses the list of phases
to route the object keys and the function that will operate over the
objects stored in those keys and instruct the proper <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/learn/glossary/#vnode">vnode</a> to
run that function over the right objects.</p>

<p>After running the map function, the results are sent back to the
coordinating node. This node then concatenates the list and passes that
information over to a reduce phase on the same coordinating node,
assuming that the next phase in the list is a reduce phase.</p>

<p>The diagram below provides an illustration of how a coordinating vnode
orchestrates a MapReduce job.</p>

<p><img src="/images/MapReduce-diagram.png" alt="MapReduce Diagram" /></p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, we’ll create four objects with the text “caremad”
repeated a varying number of times and store those objects in the bucket
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> (which does not bear a <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/usage/bucket-types">bucket type</a>).
An Erlang MapReduce function will be used to count the occurrences of
the word “caremad.”</p>

<h3 id="data-object-input-commands">Data object input commands</h3>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, we’ll use <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>
in conjunction with Riak KV’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.2/developing/api/http">HTTP API</a> to store the objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-curl">curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/buckets/training/keys/foo \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'caremad data goes here'

curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/buckets/training/keys/bar \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'caremad caremad caremad caremad'

curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/buckets/training/keys/baz \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'nothing to see here'

curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/buckets/training/keys/bam \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d 'caremad caremad caremad'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="mapreduce-invocation">MapReduce invocation</h3>

<p>To invoke a MapReduce function from a compiled Erlang program requires
that the function be compiled and distributed to all nodes.</p>

<p>For interactive use, however, it’s not necessary to do so; instead, we
can invoke the client library from the
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/shell.html">Erlang shell</a> and define
functions to send to Riak KV on the fly.</p>

<p>First we defined the map function, which specifies that we want to get
the key for each object in the bucket <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> that contains the text
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">caremad</code>.</p>

<p>We’re going to generalize and optimize it a bit by supplying a
compiled regular expression when we invoke MapReduce; our function
will expect that as the third argument.</p>

<div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">ReFun</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">fun</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">O</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">_,</span> <span class="nv">Re</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nn">re</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">riak_object</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">get_value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">O</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nv">Re</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">global</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="k">of</span>
    <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">match</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Matches</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nn">riak_object</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">O</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nb">length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">Matches</span><span class="p">)}];</span>
    <span class="n">nomatch</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nn">riak_object</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">O</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">}]</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">end</span><span class="p">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReFun</code> on all keys in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> bucket, we can do
the following in the Erlang shell.</p>

<p>Do not use this in a production
environment; listing all keys to identify those in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> bucket 
is a very expensive process.</p>

<div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Re</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">re</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"caremad"</span><span class="p">).</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That will return output along the following lines, verifying that
compilation has completed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{ok,{re_pattern,0,0,
                &lt;&lt;69,82,67,80,69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,99,0,100,
                  ...&gt;&gt;}}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can create a socket link to our cluster:</p>

<div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Riak</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nn">riakc_pb_socket</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">start_link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"127.0.0.1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8087</span><span class="p">).</span>

<span class="c">%% This should return a process ID:
%% {ok,&lt;0.34.0&gt;}
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we can run the compiled MapReduce job on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> bucket:</p>

<div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">riakc_pb_socket</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">mapred_bucket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">Riak</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"training"</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">[{</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">qfun</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">ReFun</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nv">Re</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">true</span><span class="p">}]).</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If your bucket is part of a bucket type, you would use the following:</p>

<div class="language-erlang highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">B</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"my_bucket_type"</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="s">"training"</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">},</span>
<span class="nv">Args</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">qfun</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">ReFun</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nv">Re</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">true</span><span class="p">}]),</span>
<span class="nn">riakc_pb_socket</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">mapred_bucket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">Riak</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">B</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">Args</span><span class="p">).</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That will return a list of tuples. The first element in each tuple is
the key for each object in the bucket, while the second element displays
the number of instances of the word “caremad” in the object:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{ok,[{0,
      [{&lt;&lt;"foo"&gt;&gt;,1},{&lt;&lt;"bam"&gt;&gt;,3},{&lt;&lt;"baz"&gt;&gt;,0},{&lt;&lt;"bar"&gt;&gt;,4}]}]}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>In this tutorial, we ran an Erlang MapReduce function against a total of
four object in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">training</code> bucket. This job took each key/value
object in the bucket and searched the text for the word “caremad,”
counting the number of instances of the word.</p>
