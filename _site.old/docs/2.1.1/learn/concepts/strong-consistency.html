<p>Riak KV’s strong consistency is an experimental feature and may be removed
from the product in the future. Strong consistency is not commercially
supported or production-ready. Strong consistency is incompatible with
Multi-Datacenter Replication, Riak Search, Bitcask Expiration, LevelDB
Secondary Indexes, Riak Data Types and Commit Hooks. We do not recommend its
usage in any production environment.</p>

<p>Riak was originally designed as an <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency">eventually consistent</a> system, fundamentally geared toward providing partition
(i.e. fault) tolerance and high read and write availability.</p>

<p>While this focus on high availability is a great fit for many data
storage needs, there are also many use cases for which strong data
consistency is more important than availability. Basho introduced a new
strong consistency option in version 2.0 to address these use cases.
In Riak, strong consistency is applied <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/usage/bucket-types">using bucket types</a>, which
enables developers to apply strong consistency guarantees on a per-key
basis.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the documentation there are instructions for <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/app-guide/strong-consistency/">enabling and using</a> strong consistency, as well as a <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/configuring/strong-consistency">guide for operators</a> looking to manage,
configure, and monitor strong consistency.</p>

<h2 id="strong-vs-eventual-consistency">Strong vs. Eventual Consistency</h2>

<p>If you successfully write a value to a key in a strongly consistent
system, the next successful read of that key is guaranteed to show that
write. A client will never see out-of-date values. The drawback is that
some operations may fail if an insufficient number of object replicas
are available. More on this in the section on <a href="#trade-offs">trade-offs</a>.</p>

<p>In an eventually consistent system, on the other hand, a read may return
an out-of-date value, particularly during system or network failures.
The advantage of this approach is that reads and writes can succeed even
when a cluster is experiencing significant service degradation.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Building on the example presented in the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency">eventual consistency</a> doc,
imagine that information about who manages Manchester United is stored
in Riak, in the key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code>. In the eventual consistency
example, the value associated with this key was originally
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">David Moyes</code>, meaning that that was the first successful write to that
key. But then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Louis van Gaal</code> became Man U’s manager, and a write was
executed to change the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code>.</p>

<p>Now imagine that this write failed on one node in a multi-node cluster.
Thus, all nodes report that the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Louis
van Gaal</code> except for one. On the errant node, the value of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code> key is still <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">David Moyes</code>. An eventually
consistent system is one in which a get request will most likely return
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Louis van Gaal</code> but could return the outdated value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">David Moyes</code>.</p>

<p>In a strongly consistent system, conversely, any successful read on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code> will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Louis van Gaal</code> and never <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">David Moyes</code>.
Reads will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Louis van Gaal</code> every single time until Man U gets a new
manager and someone performs a successful write to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manchester-manager</code>
to change its value.</p>

<p>It might also be useful to imagine it a bit more abstractly. The
following causal sequence would characterize a strongly consistent
system:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The value of the key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code></li>
  <li>All successful reads on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code></li>
  <li>The value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> is changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code></li>
  <li>All successful reads on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code></li>
  <li>And so forth</li>
</ol>

<p>At no point in time does this system return an out-of-date value.</p>

<p>The following sequence could characterize an eventually consistent
system:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A write is made that sets the value of the key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code></li>
  <li>Nearly all reads to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>, but a small percentage return
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not found</code></li>
  <li>A write to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> changes the value to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code></li>
  <li>Nearly all reads to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> now return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code>, but a small number return
the outdated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code> (or even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not found</code>) because the newer value hasn’t
yet been replicated to all nodes</li>
</ol>
