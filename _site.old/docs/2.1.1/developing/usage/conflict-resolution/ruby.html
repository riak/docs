<p>For reasons explained in the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/usage/conflict-resolution">Introduction to conflict resolution</a>, we strongly recommend adopting a
conflict resolution strategy that requires applications to resolve
siblings according to use-case-specific criteria. Here, we’ll provide a
brief guide to conflict resolution using the official <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client">Riak Ruby
client</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-ruby-client-handles-conflict-resolution">How the Ruby Client Handles Conflict Resolution</h2>

<p>In the official Ruby client, every Riak object has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siblings</code> property
that provides access to a list of that object’s sibling values. If there
are no siblings, that property will return an array with only one item.
Here’s an example of an object with siblings:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bucket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">bucket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'seahawks'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bucket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'coach'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span>

<span class="c1"># The output:</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="c1">#&lt;Riak::RContent [content/type]: "Jim Mora"&gt;, #&lt;Riak::RContent [content/type]: "Pete Carroll"&gt;]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So what happens if the length of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.siblings</code> is greater than 1, as in
the case above? In order to resolve siblings, you need to create a
resolution function that takes a Riak object and reduces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siblings</code>
array down to a single value. An example is provided in the section
below.</p>

<h2 id="basic-conflict-resolution-example">Basic Conflict Resolution Example</h2>

<p>Let’s say that we’re building a social network application and storing
lists of usernames representing each user’s “friends.” Each user will be
of the class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code>, which we’ll create below. All of the data for our
application will be stored in buckets that bear the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/usage/bucket-types">bucket type</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siblings</code>, and for this bucket type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_mult</code> is set
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, which means that Riak will generate siblings in certain
cases—siblings that our application will need to be equipped to
resolve when necessary.</p>

<p>The question that we need to ask ourselves at this point is the
following: if a given user has conflicting lists, which list should be
deemed more “correct?” What criteria should be applied? Should the lists
be merged? Should we pick a list at random and deem that list correct?
We’ll keep it simple here and say that the following criterion will
hold: if multiple conflict lists exist, <em>the longer list will be the one
that our application deems correct</em>. While this might not make sense in
real-world applications, it’s a good jumping-off point.</p>

<h3 id="creating-our-data-class">Creating Our Data Class</h3>

<p>We’ll start by creating a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> class for each user’s data. Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code>
object will consist of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">friends</code> property that lists
the usernames, as strings, of the user’s friends. We will also create a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to_json</code> method, as we’ll be storing each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> object as JSON:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">friends</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">username</span>
    <span class="vi">@friends</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">friends</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">to_json</span>
    <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:username</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="vi">@username</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:friends</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="vi">@friends</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> objects and see what they look like as JSON:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">new_user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'riakuser127'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'captheorem238'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'siblingsrule572'</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="n">new_user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_json</span>
<span class="c1"># {'username': 'riakuser127', 'friends': ['captheorem238', 'siblingsrule572']}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="implementing-a-conflict-resolution-function">Implementing a Conflict Resolution Function</h3>

<p>Let’s say that we’ve stored a bunch of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> objects in Riak and that a
few concurrent writes have led to siblings. How is our application going
to deal with that? First, let’s say that there’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> object stored
in the bucket <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users</code> (which is of the bucket type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siblings</code>, as
explained above) under the key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bashobunny</code>. We can fetch the object
that is stored there and see if it has siblings:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bucket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">bucket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'users'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bucket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'bashobunny'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">type: </span><span class="s1">'siblings'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, then there are siblings. So what do we do in that
case? At this point, we need to write a function that resolves the list
of siblings, i.e. reduces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.siblings</code> array down to one member.
In our case, we need a function that takes a single Riak object (or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RObject</code> in the Ruby client) as its argument, applies some logic to the
list of values contained in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siblings</code> property of the object, and
returns a single value. For our example use case here, we’ll return the
sibling with the longest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">friends</code> list:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">longest_friends_list_resolver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># The "conflict?" method is built into the Ruby client</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">conflict?</span>
    <span class="c1"># The "max_by" method enables us to select the sibling with the</span>
    <span class="c1"># longest "friends" list</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">max_by</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'friends'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="c1"># If there are no siblings, we can simply return the object's</span>
    <span class="c1"># "content" as is</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then embed this function into a more general function for
fetching objects from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users</code> bucket:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fetch_user_by_username</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">bucket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">bucket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'users'</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">user_object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bucket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">longest_friends_list_resolve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_object</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">user_object</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">bashobunny</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fetch_user_by_username</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'bashobunny'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, when a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> object is fetched (assuming that the username acts as
a key for the object), a single value is returned for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">friends</code>
list. This means that our application can now use a “correct” value
instead of having to deal with multiple values.</p>

<h2 id="conflict-resolution-and-writes">Conflict Resolution and Writes</h2>

<p>In the above example, we created a conflict resolver that resolves a
list of discrepant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> objects and returns a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code>. It’s
important to note, however, that this resolver will only provide the
application with a single “correct” value; it will <em>not</em> write that
value back to Riak. That requires a separate step. When this step should
be undertaken depends on your application. In general, though, we
recommend writing objects to Riak only when the application is ready to
commit them, i.e. when all of the changes that need to be made to the
object have been made and the application is ready to persist the state
of the object in Riak.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, we recommend that updates to objects in Riak follow
these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Read</strong> the object from Riak</li>
  <li><strong>Resolving sibling conflicts</strong> if they exist, allowing the
application to reason about one “correct” value for the object (this
step is the subject of this tutorial)</li>
  <li><strong>Modify</strong> the object</li>
  <li><strong>Write</strong> the object to Riak once the necessary changes have been
made</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find more on writing objects to Riak, including examples from
the official Ruby client library, in the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/usage">Developing with Riak KV: Usage</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="more-advanced-example">More Advanced Example</h2>

<p>Resolving sibling User values on the basis of which user has the longest
friends list has the benefit of being simple but it’s probably not a
good resolution strategy for our social networking application because
it means that unwanted data loss is inevitable. If one friend list
contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> and the other contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>, the list
containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> will be chosen. So what about friends <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>? Those usernames are essentially lost. In the sections below,
we’ll implement an alternative strategy as an example.</p>

<h3 id="merging-the-lists">Merging the Lists</h3>

<p>To avoid losing data like this, a better strategy would be to merge the
lists. We can modify our original resolver function to accomplish
precisely that and will also store the resulting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> object:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">longest_friends_list_resolver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># An empty array for use later on</span>
  <span class="n">friends_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">conflict?</span>
    <span class="c1"># The "friends" arrays for all siblings will be merged into one</span>
    <span class="c1"># array</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">sibling</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">friends_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sibling</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'friends'</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="c1"># Then we make a new User object. First, we fetch the username from</span>
    <span class="c1"># any one of the siblings, then we pass in our new friends list,</span>
    <span class="c1"># calling the "uniq" method to eliminate duplicate usernames.</span>
    <span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'username'</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">new_user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">friends_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">uniq</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># Now we reuse the first sibling as a container for the merged data</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">new_user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_json</span>

    <span class="c1"># And finally we set the siblings property to include just the</span>
    <span class="c1"># single, resolved sibling</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">siblings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]]</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="n">riak_object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">content</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The drawback to this approach is the following: with a conflict
resolution strategy like this, it’s more or less inevitable that a user
will remove a friend from their friends list, and that that friend will
end up back on the list during a conflict resolution operation. While
that’s certainly not desirable, that is likely better than the
alternative proposed in the first example, which entails usernames being
simply dropped from friends lists. Sibling resolution strategies almost
always carry potential drawbacks of this sort.</p>

<h2 id="riak-data-types">Riak Data Types</h2>

<p>An important thing to always bear in mind when working with conflict
resolution is that Riak offers a variety of <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/data-types/">Data Types</a> that have
specific conflict resolution mechanics built in. If you have data that
can be modeled as a <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/data-types/counters">counter</a>, <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/data-types/sets">set</a>, or <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/data-types/maps">map</a>, then you should seriously
consider using those Data Types instead of creating your own
application-side resolution logic.</p>

<p>In the example above, we were dealing with conflict resolution within a
set, in particular the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">friends</code> list associated with each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code></p>

<p>object. The merge operation that we built to handle conflict resolution
is analogous to the resolution logic that is built into Riak sets. For
more information on how you could potentially replace the client-side
resolution that we implemented above, see our <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.1/developing/data-types/sets">tutorial on Riak sets</a>.</p>
