<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Riak Enterprise includes a feature that cascades realtime writes across
multiple clusters.</p>

<p>Cascading Realtime Writes is enabled by default on new clusters running
Riak Enterprise. It will need to be manually enabled on new clusters.</p>

<p>Cascading realtime requires the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{riak_repl, rtq_meta}</code> capability to
function.</p>

<p>Cascading tracking is a simple list of where an object has been written. This
works well for most common configurations. Larger installations, however, may
have writes cascade to clusters to which other clusters have already written.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+---+     +---+     +---+
| A | &lt;-&gt; | B | &lt;-&gt; | C |
+---+     +---+     +---+
  ^                   ^
  |                   |
  V                   V
+---+     +---+     +---+
| F | &lt;-&gt; | E | &lt;-&gt; | D |
+---+     +---+     +---+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the diagram above, a write at cluster A will begin two cascades. One
goes to B, C, D, E, and finally F; the other goes to F, E, D, C, and
finally B. Each cascade will loop around to A again, sending a
replication request even if the same request has already occurred from
the opposite direction, creating 3 extra write requests.</p>

<p>This can be mitigated by disabling cascading in a cluster. If cascading
were disabled on cluster D, a write at A would begin two cascades. One
would go through B, C, and D, the other through F, E, and D. This
reduces the number of extraneous write requests to 1.</p>

<p>A different topology can also prevent extra write requests:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+---+                     +---+
| A |                     | E |
+---+                     +---+
 ^  ^                     ^  ^
 |   \  +---+     +---+  /   |
 |    &gt; | C | &lt;-&gt; | D | &lt;    |
 |   /  +---+     +---+  \   |
 V  V                     V  V
+---+                     +---+
| B |                     | F |
+---+                     +---+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A write at A will cascade to C and B. B will not cascade to C because
A will have already added C to the list of clusters where the write has
occurred. C will then cascade to D. D then cascades to E and F. E and F
see that the other was sent a write request (by D), and so they do not
cascade.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Riak Enterprise Cascading Writes can be enabled and disabled using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl</code> command. Please see the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/using/cluster-operations/v3-multi-datacenter">Version 3 Operations guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To show current the settings:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl realtime cascades</code></p>

<p>To enable cascading:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl realtime cascades always</code></p>

<p>To disable cascading:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl realtime cascades never</code></p>
