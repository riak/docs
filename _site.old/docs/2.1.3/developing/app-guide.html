<p>So you’ve decided to build an application using Riak as a data store. We
think that this is a wise choice for a broad variety of use cases. But
using Riak isn’t always straightforward, especially if you’re used to
developing with relational databases like like MySQL or PostgreSQL or
non-persistent key/value stores like Redis. So in this guide, we’ll walk
you through a set of questions that should be asked about your use case
before getting started. The answer to those questions may inform
decisions about which Riak features you should use, what kind of
replication and conflict resolution strategies you should employ, and
perhaps even how parts of your application should be built.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-data-are-you-storing">What Kind of Data Are You Storing?</h2>

<p>This is an important initial question for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Not all data is a good fit for Riak. If your data isn’t a good fit,
we would advise that you seek out a storage system that better suits
your needs.</li>
  <li>The kinds of data that you’re storing should guide your decision both
about <em>how</em> to store and access your data in Riak and about which Riak
features would be helpful (and which ones might even be harmful).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="good-fits-for-riak">Good Fits for Riak</h3>

<p>Riak tends to be an excellent choice if you’re dealing with any of the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Immutable data</strong> — While Riak provides several means of
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/conflict-resolution">resolving conflicts</a> between different replicas
of objects, those processes can lead to slower performance in some
cases. Storing immutable data means that you can avoid those processes
altogether and get the most out of Riak.</li>
  <li><strong>Small objects</strong> — Riak was not built as a store for large objects
like video files or other
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">BLOB</a>s. We built
<a href="http://basho.com/riak-cloud-storage/">Riak CS</a> for that. Riak is
great, however, for JSON, <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling/#log-data">log files</a>, <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling/#sensor-data">sensor data</a>, HTML files, and other objects that tend
to run smaller than 1 MB.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent objects</strong> — Objects that do not have interdependencies
on other objects are a good fit for Riak’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency">eventually consistent</a> nature.</li>
  <li><strong>Objects with “natural” keys</strong> — It is almost always advisable to
build keys for objects out of timestamps, <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling/#user-data">usernames</a>,
or other <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/key-value-modeling">“natural” markers</a> that distinguish
that object from other objects. Data that can be modeled this way fits
nicely with Riak because Riak emphasizes extremely fast object lookup.</li>
  <li><strong>Data compatible with <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types">Riak Data Types</a></strong> — If
you’re working with mutable data, one option is to run basic CRUD
operations on that data in a standard key/value fashion and either
manage conflict resolution yourself or allow Riak to do so. But if
your data can be modeled as a <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/counters">counter</a>,
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/sets">set</a>, or <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/maps">map</a>, you
should seriously consider using <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types">Riak Data Types</a>,
which can speed application development and transfer a great deal of
complexity away from the application and to Riak itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="not-so-good-fits-for-riak">Not-so-good Fits for Riak</h3>

<p>Riak may not such be a good choice if you use it to store:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Objects that exceed 1-2MB in size</strong> — If you will be
storing a lot of objects over that size, we would recommend checking
out <a href="http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/">Riak CS</a> instead, as Riak
CS was built to solve this problem. Storing large objects in Riak will
typically lead to substandard performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Objects with complex interdependencies</strong> — If your data cannot be
easily denormalized or if it requires that objects can be easily
assembled into and accessible as larger wholes—think columns or
tables—then you might want to consider a relational database
instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>If it sounds like Riak is a good choice for some or all of your
application’s data needs, move on to the next sections, where you can
find out more about which Riak features are recommendable for your use
case, how you should model your data, and what kinds of data modeling
and development strategies we recommend.</p>

<h2 id="which-features-should-you-consider">Which Features Should You Consider?</h2>

<p>Basic CRUD key/value operations are almost always the most performant
operations when using Riak. If your needs can be served using CRUD
operations, we recommend checking out our tutorial on <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/key-value-modeling">key/value modeling</a> for some basic guidelines. But if basic CRUD key/value
operations don’t quite suffice for your use case, Riak offers a variety
of features that may be just what you’re looking for. In the sections
immediately below, you can find brief descriptions of those features as
well as relevant links to Basho documentation.</p>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

<p>Riak Search provides you with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache
Solr</a>-powered full-text indexing and
querying on top of the scalability, fault tolerance, and operational
simplicity of Riak. Our motto for Riak Search: <strong>Write it like Riak.
Query it like Solr</strong>. That is, you can store objects in Riak <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/creating-objects">like normal</a> and run full-text queries on those objects later on
using the Solr API.</p>

consideration behind Riak Search</li>
  <li>[Search Schema][usage search schema] — How to create custom schemas for extracting data
from Riak Search</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-use-search">When to Use Search</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you need a rich querying API</strong> — Riak Search gives you access
to the entirety of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>’s extremely
broad API, which enables you to query on the basis of wildcards,
strings, booleans, geolocation, ranges, language-specific fulltext,
and far more. You can even use Search in conjunction with <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types">Riak Data Types</a> (documentation coming soon).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Search is preferred for querying</strong></p>

  <p>In general, you should consider Search to be the default choice for
nearly all querying needs that go beyond basic CRUD/KV operations. If
your use case demands some sort of querying mechanism and you’re in
doubt about what to use, you should assume that Search is the right tool
for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-search">When Not to Use Search</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When deep pagination is needed</strong> — At the moment, you should
  consider <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary indexes</a> instead of
  Search if your use case requires deep pagination. This will be
  changed, however, in a future release of Riak, at which point you
  should consider Search the default choice for <em>all</em> querying needs.</li>
  <li><strong>In large clusters</strong> — In clusters larger than 8-10 nodes, you may
  experience slower performance when using Search. In clusters of that
  size, we would recommend using Search in a limited fashion, setting
  up a separate, dedicated cluster for Search data, or finding another
  solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="riak-data-types">Riak Data Types</h2>

<p>When performing basic K/V operations, Riak is agnostic toward the actual
data stored within objects. Beginning with Riak 2.0, however, you now
have access to operations-based objects based on academic research on
<a href="http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf">CRDTs</a>. Riak
Data Types enable you to update and read <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/counters">counters</a>,
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/sets">sets</a>, and <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/maps">maps</a> directly in Riak, as well as <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/maps">registers</a> and <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/maps">flags</a> inside of Riak maps.</p>

<p>The beauty of Riak Data Types is that all convergence logic is handled
by Riak itself according to deterministic, Data Type-specific rules,
which means that your application doesn’t need to reason about
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/conflict-resolution">siblings</a>. In many cases, this can
unburden applications of the need to handle object convergence on their
own.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>

  <p>Riak Data Types can be used in conjunction with Riak Search,
meaning that the data stored in counters, sets, and maps can be indexed
and searched just like any other data in Riak. Documentation on Data
Types and Search is coming soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="when-to-use-riak-data-types">When to Use Riak Data Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When your data fits</strong> — If the data that you’re storing can be
modeled as one of the five available types, Riak Data Types could be a
very good option. Please note that in many cases there may not be a
1:1 correspondence between the five available types and the data that
you’d like to store, but there may be workarounds to close the gap.
Most things that can be stored as JSON, for example, can be stored as
maps (though with modifications).</li>
  <li><strong>When you don’t need to reason about siblings</strong> — If your use case
doesn’t require that your application have access to siblings and
allows for sibling convergence logic to take place at the Riak level
rather than at the application level, then Riak Data Types are well
worth exploring.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-riak-data-types">When Not to Use Riak Data Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you need to provide your own convergence logic</strong> — If your
application needs to have access to all sibling values, then Riak Data
Types are not a good choice because they by definition do not produce
siblings.</li>
  <li><strong>When you want to take advantage of <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/app-guide/write-once">write-once buckets</a></strong>
— If your application writes immutable data then it can benefit
from using write-once buckets.  This feature, however, is incompatible
with Riak Data Types.</li>
  <li><strong>When your data just doesn’t fit</strong> — While the five existing Data
Types allow for a great deal of flexibility and a wide range of use
cases, they don’t cover all use cases. If you have data that requires
a modeling solution that can’t be covered, you should stick to
standard K/V operations.</li>
  <li><strong>When object size is of significant concern</strong> — Riak Data Types
behave much like other Riak objects, but they tend to carry more
metadata than normal Riak objects, especially maps. In most cases the
metadata payload will be a small percentage of the object’s total
size, but if you want to keep objects as lean as possible, it may be
better to stick to normal K/V operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mapreduce">MapReduce</h2>

<p>Riak’s MapReduce feature enables you to perform batch processing jobs in
a way that leverages Riak’s distributed nature. When a MapReduce job is
sent to Riak, Riak automatically distributes the processing work to
where the target data lives, which can reduce network bandwidth. Riak
comes equipped with a set of default MapReduce jobs that you can employ,
or you can write and run your own MapReduce jobs in
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/mapreduce">Using MapReduce</a> — A general guide to using MapReduce</li>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/app-guide/advanced-mapreduce">Advanced MapReduce</a> — A more in-depth guide to MapReduce,
including code samples and implementation details</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-use-mapreduce">When to Use MapReduce</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Batch processing only</strong> — You should use MapReduce only when truly
truly necessary. MapReduce jobs are very computationally expensive and
can degrade performance in production clusters. You should restrict
MapReduce usage to infrequent batch processing operations, preferably
carried out at times when your cluster is experiencing load that is
well below average.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-mapreduce">When Not to Use MapReduce</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When another Riak feature will do</strong> — Before even considering
using MapReduce, you should thoroughly investigate <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/search">Riak Search</a> or <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary indexes</a> as possible
solutions to your needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, you should not think of MapReduce as, for example, Hadoop
within Riak. While it can be useful for certain types of
non-primary-key-based queries, it is neither a “Big Data” processing
tool nor an indexing mechanism nor a replacement for <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/search">Riak Search</a>. If you do need a tool like Hadoop or Apache Spark, you should
consider using Riak in conjunction with a more suitable data processing
tool.</p>

<h2 id="secondary-indexes-2i">Secondary Indexes (2i)</h2>

<p>Using basic key/value operations in Riak sometimes leads to the
following problem: how do I know which keys I should look for? Secondary
indexes (2i) provide a solution to this problem, enabling you to tag
objects with either binary or integer metadata and then query Riak for
all of the keys that share specific tags. 2i is especially useful if
you’re storing binary data that is opaque to features like <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/search">Riak Search</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">Using Secondary Indexes</a> — A general guide to using 2i, along
with code samples and information on 2i features like pagination,
streaming, and sorting</li>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/using/reference/secondary-indexes">Advanced Secondary Indexes</a> — Implementation details behind 2i</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-to-use-secondary-indexes">When to Use Secondary Indexes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you require deep pagination</strong> — At the moment, 2i’s
  deep pagination capabilities are more performant than those offered
  by Search if you require pagination of more than 3-5 pages. This
  will change, however, in the future, at which point we will
  recommend using Search instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-secondary-indexes">When Not to Use Secondary Indexes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For most querying purposes</strong> — If your use case does not
  involve deep pagination, we recommend Search over 2i for <em>all</em>
  querying purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>If you’re using Bitcask</strong> — 2i is available only in the
  <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/setup/planning/backend/leveldb">LevelDB</a> backend. If you’d like to use <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/setup/planning/backend/bitcask">Bitcask</a> or the <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/setup/planning/backend/memory">Memory</a> backend, you will not be able to use 2i.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mixed-approach">Mixed Approach</h2>

<p>One thing to always bear in mind is that Riak enables you to mix and
match a wide variety of approaches in a single cluster. You can use
basic CRUD operations for some of your data, index some of your data to
be queried by Riak Search, use Riak Data Types for another subset, etc.
You are always free to use a wide array of Riak features—or you can
use none at all and stick to key/value operations.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-you-model-your-data">How Should You Model Your Data?</h2>

<p>It’s difficult to offer universally applicable data modeling guidelines
because data models differ so markedly from use case to use case. What
works when storing <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling/#user-data">user data</a>, for example, might
be a poor fit when working with <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling/#sensor-data">sensor data</a>.
Nonetheless, there’s a variety of material in our documentation that
might be helpful when thinking about data modeling:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="data-types">Data Types</h3>

<p>One feature to always bear in mind when using Riak is <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types">Riak Data Types</a>. If some or all of your data can be modeled in
accordance with one of the available Data Types—flags (similar to
Booleans), registers (good for storing small binaries or text snippets),
<a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/counters">counters</a>, <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/sets">sets</a>,
or <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-types/maps">maps</a>—you might be able to streamline
application development by using them as an alternative to key/value
operations. In some cases, it might even be worthwhile to transform your
data modeling strategy in accordance with To see if this feature might
be a good fit for your application, we recommend checking out the
following documentation:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/data-modeling">Data Modeling with Riak Data Types</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-your-consistency-requirements">What are Your Consistency Requirements?</h2>

<p>Riak has traditionally been thought of as an <a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency">eventually consistent</a>, AP system, i.e. as a system that
favors availability and partition tolerance over data consistency. In
Riak versions 2.0 and later, the option of applying strong consistency
guarantees is available to developers that want to use Riak as a strict
CP system. One of the advantages of Riak’s approach to strong
consistency is that you don’t need to store all of your data in a
strongly consistent fashion if you use this feature. Instead, you can
mix and match a CP approach with an AP approach in a single cluster in
any way you wish.</p>

<p>If you need some or all of your data to be subject to strong consistency
requirements, we recommend checking out the following documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/riak/2.1.3/using/reference/strong-consistency">Strong Consistency</a></li>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/app-guide/strong-consistency">Using Strong Consistency</a></li>
  <li><a href="/riak/kv/2.1.3/using/cluster-operations/strong-consistency">Managing Strong Consistency</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="are-your-objects-mutable">Are Your Objects Mutable?</h2>

<p>Although Riak always performs best when storing and retrieving immutable
data, Riak also handles mutable objects very ably using a variety of
eventual consistency principles. Storing mutable data in Riak, however,
can get tricky because it requires you to choose and implement a
conflict resolution strategy for when object conflicts arise, which is a
normal occurrence in Riak. For more implementation details, we recommend
checking out the following docs:</p>

<ul>
