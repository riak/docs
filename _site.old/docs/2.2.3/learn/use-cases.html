<p>Riak is a flexible data storage technology capable of addressing a wide variety
of problems in a scalable way. In this guide, we’ll list a number of use cases
and data models that are a good fit for Riak. All of these use cases are already
being used in production for projects large and small. We’ll also suggest
possibilities for implementation and provide links to videos and documentation
for further exploration.</p>

<p>How you structure your application to run on Riak should take into account the
unique needs of your use case, including access patterns such as read/write
distribution, latency differences between various operations, use of Riak
features including <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/data-types">Data Types</a>, <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/mapreduce">MapReduce</a>,
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/search">Search</a>, <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary indexes (2i)</a>, and
more. This guide is intended to be illustrative only.</p>

<h2 id="session-storage">Session Storage</h2>

<p>Riak was originally created to serve as a highly scalable session store. This is
an ideal use case for Riak, which is always most performant and predictable when
used as a key/value store. Since user and session IDs are usually stored in
cookies or otherwise known at lookup time, Riak is able to serve these requests
with predictably low latency. Riak’s content-type agnosticism also imposes no
restrictions on the value, so session data can be encoded in many ways and can
evolve without administrative changes to schemas.</p>

<h3 id="complex-session-storage-case">Complex Session Storage Case</h3>

<p>Riak has features that allow for more complex session storage use cases. The
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/setup/planning/backend/bitcask">Bitcask</a> storage backend, for example, supports automatic
expiry of keys, which frees application developers from implementing manual
session expiry. Riak’s <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/mapreduce">MapReduce</a> system can also be used to
perform batch processing analysis on large bodies of session data, for example
to compute the average number of active users. If sessions must be retrieved
using multiple keys (e.g. a UUID or email address),
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">using secondary indexes</a> can provide an easy solution.</p>

<h2 id="serving-advertisements">Serving Advertisements</h2>

<p>Riak is often a good choice for serving advertising content to many different
web and mobile users simultaneously with low latency. Content of this sort, e.g.
images or text, can be stored in Riak using unique generated either by the
application or by Riak. Keys can be created based on, for example, a campaign or
company ID for easy retrieval.</p>

<h3 id="serving-advertisements-complex-case">Serving Advertisements Complex Case</h3>

<p>In the advertising industry, being able to serve ads quickly to many users and
platforms is often the most important factor in selecting and tuning a database.
Riak’s tunable <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/app-guide/replication-properties">apps replication properties</a> can be set
to favor fast read performance. By setting R to 1, only one of N replicas will
need to be returned to complete a read operation, yielding lower read latency
than an R value equal to the number of replicas (i.e. R=N). This is ideal for
advertising traffic, which primarily involves serving reads.</p>

<h2 id="log-data">Log Data</h2>

<p>A common use case for Riak is storing large amounts of log data, either for
analysis <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">using MapReduce</a> or as a storage system used
in conjunction with a secondary analytics cluster used to perform more advanced
analytics tasks. To store log data, you can use a bucket called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logs</code> (just to
give an example) and use a unique value, such as a date, for the key. Log files
would then be the values associated with each unique key.</p>

<p>For storing log data from different systems, you could use unique buckets for
each system (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system1_log_data</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">system2_log_data</code>, etc.) and write
associated logs to the corresponding buckets. To analyze that data, you could
use Riak’s MapReduce system for aggregation tasks, such as summing the counts of
records for a date or Riak Search for a more robust, text-based queries.</p>

<h3 id="log-data-complex-case">Log Data Complex Case</h3>

<p>For storing a large amount of log data that is frequently written to Riak, some
users might consider doing primary storage of logs in a Riak cluster and then
replicating data to a secondary cluster to run heavy analytics jobs, either over
another Riak cluster or another solution such as Hadoop. Because the access
patterns of reading and writing data to Riak is very different from the access
pattern of something like a MapReduce job, which iterates over many keys,
separating the write workload from the analytics workload will let you maintain
higher performance and yield more predictable latency.</p>

<h2 id="sensor-data">Sensor Data</h2>

<p>Riak’s scalable design makes it useful for data sets, like sensor data, that
scale rapidly and are subject to heavy read/write loads. Many sensors collect
and send data at a given interval. One way to model this in Riak is to use a
bucket for each sensor device and use the time interval as a unique key (i.e. a
date or combination of date and time), and then store update data as the value.</p>

<p>That data could then be queried on the basis of the interval. Alternatively, a
timestamp could be attached to each object as a
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary index</a>, which would allow you to perform
queries on specific time interval ranges or to perform
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/mapreduce">MapReduce</a> queries against the indexes.</p>

<h3 id="sensor-data-complex-case">Sensor Data Complex Case</h3>

<p>If you are dealing with thousands or millions of sensors yet with very small
data sets, storing all of a single device’s updates as unique keys may be
cumbersome when it comes to reading that device’s data. Retrieving it all would
mean calling a number of keys.</p>

<p>Instead, you could store all of a device’s updates in a document with a unique
key to identify the device. Stored as a JSON document, you could read and parse
all of those updates on the client side. Riak, however, doesn’t allow you to
append data to a document without reading the object and writing it back to the
key. This strategy would mean more simplicity and performance on the read side
as a tradeoff for slightly more work at write time and on the client side.</p>

<p>It’s also important to keep an eye out for the total size of documents as they
grow, as we tend to recommend that Riak objects stay smaller than 1-2 MB and
preferably below 100 KB. Otherwise, performance problems in the cluster are
likely.</p>

<h2 id="user-accounts">User Accounts</h2>

<p>User accounts tend to rely on fairly straightforward data models. One way of
storing user account data in Riak would be store each user’s data as a JSON
object in a bucket called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users</code> (or whatever you wish). Keys for user data
objects could be constructed using application-specific considerations. If your
application involves user logins, for example, the simplest and most read-
efficient strategy would be to use the login username as the object key. The
username could be extracted upon login, and a read request could be performed on
the corresponding key.</p>

<p>There are, however, several drawbacks to this approach. What happens if a user
wants to change their username later on? The most common solution would be to
use a UUID-type key for the user and store the user’s username as a
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">secondary index</a> for efficient lookup.</p>

<h3 id="user-accounts-complex-case">User Accounts Complex Case</h3>

<p>For simple retrieval of a specific account, a user ID (plus perhaps a secondary
index on a username or email) is enough. If you foresee the need to make queries
on additional user attributes (e.g. creation time, user type, or region), plan
ahead and either set up additional secondary indexes or consider using
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/search">Riak Search</a> to index the JSON contents of the user account.</p>

<h2 id="user-settings-and-preferences">User Settings and Preferences</h2>

<p>For user account-related data that is simple and frequently read but rarely
changed (such as a privacy setting or theme preference), consider storing it in
the user object itself. Another common pattern is to create a companion user
settings-type of object, with keys based on user ID for easy one-read retrieval.</p>

<h3 id="user-settings-and-preferences-complex-case">User Settings and Preferences Complex Case</h3>

<p>If you find your application frequently writing to the user account or have
dynamically growing user-related data such as bookmarks, subscriptions, or
multiple notifications, then a more advanced data model may be called for.</p>

<h2 id="user-events-and-timelines">User Events and Timelines</h2>

<p>Sometimes you may want to do more complex or specific kinds of modeling user
data. A common example would be storing data for assembling a social network
timeline. To create a user timeline, you could use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeline</code> bucket in Riak
and form keys on the basis of a unique user ID. You would store timeline
information as the value, e.g. a list of status update IDs which could then be
used to retrieve the full information from another bucket, or perhaps containing
the full status update. If you want to store additional data, such as a
timestamp, category or list of properties, you can turn the list into an array
of hashes containing this additional information.</p>

<p>Note than in Riak you cannot append information to an object, so adding events
in the timeline would necessarily involve reading the full object, modifying it,
and writing back the new value.</p>

<h2 id="articles-blog-posts-and-other-content">Articles, Blog Posts, and Other Content</h2>

<p>The simplest way to model blog posts, articles, or similar content is to use a
bucket in Riak with some unique attribute for logical division of content, such
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blogs</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">articles</code>. Keys could be constructed out of unique identifiers
for posts, perhaps the title of each article, a combination of the title and
data/time, an integer that can be used as part of a URL string, etc.</p>

<p>In Riak, you can store content of any kind, from HTML files to plain text to
JSON or XML or another document type entirely. Keep in mind that data in Riak is
opaque, with the exception of <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/data-types">Riak Data Types</a>, and so Riak
won’t “know” about the object unless it is indexed
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/search">using Riak Search</a> or
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">using secondary indexes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="articles-et-al-complex-case">Articles et al Complex Case</h3>

<p>Setting up a data model for content becomes more complex based on the querying
and search requirements of your application. For example, you may have different
kinds of content that you want to generate in a view, e.g. not just a post but
also comments, user profile information, etc.</p>

<p>For many Riak developers, it will make sense to divide content into different
buckets, e.g. a bucket for comments that would be stored in the Riak cluster
along with the posts bucket. Comments for a given post could be stored as a
document with the same key as the content post, though with a different
bucket/key combination. Another possibility would be to store each comment with
its own ID. Loading the full view with comments would require your application
to call from the posts and comments buckets to assemble the view.</p>

<p>Other possible cases may involve performing operations on content beyond
key/value pairs. <a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/search">Riak Search</a> is recommended for use cases
involving full-text search. For lighter-weight querying,
<a href="/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/secondary-indexes">using secondary indexes</a> (2i) enables you to add
metadata to objects to either query for exact matches or to perform range
queries. 2i also enables you to tag posts with dates, timestamps, topic areas,
or other pieces of information useful for later retrieval.</p>
