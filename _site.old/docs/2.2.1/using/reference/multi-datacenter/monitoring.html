<p>Monitoring Riak’s realtime replication allows you to identify trends and
to receive alerts during times when replication is halted or delayed.
Issues or delays in replication can be caused by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sudden increases or spikes in write traffic</li>
  <li>Network connectivity issues or outages</li>
  <li>Errors experienced in Riak</li>
</ul>

<p>Identification and trending of issues or delays in realtime replication
is important for identifying a root cause, while alerting is important
for addressing any SLA-impacting issues or delays. We recommend
combining the two approaches below when monitoring Riak’s realtime
replication:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monitor Riak’s replication status output, from either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl
status</code> or the HTTP <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/riak-repl/stats</code> endpoint</li>
  <li>Use canary (test) objects to test replication and establish trip times
from source to sink clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>Riak’s statistics are calculated over a sliding 60-second window. Each time
you query the stats interface, each sliding statistic shown is a sum or
histogram value calculated from the previous 60 seconds of data. Because of
this, the stats interface should not be queried more than once per minute.</p>

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>

<p>The following questions can be answered through the monitoring and
graphing of realtime replication statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the realtime replication queue backed up?</li>
  <li>Have any errors occurred on either the source or sink cluster?</li>
  <li>Have any objects been dropped from the realtime queue?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="is-the-realtime-replication-queue-backed-up">Is the realtime replication queue backed up?</h4>

<p>Identifying times when the realtime replication queue experiences
increases in the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending</code> objects can help identify problems
with realtime replication or identify times when replication becomes
overloaded due to increases in traffic. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending</code> statistic, found
under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">realtime_queue_stats</code> section of the replication status
output, should be monitored and graphed. Graphing this statistic allows
you to identify trends in the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending</code> objects. Any repeating
or predictable trend in this statistic can be used to help identify a
need for tuning and capacity changes, while unexpected variation in this
statistic may indicate either sudden changes in load or errors at the
network, system, or Riak level.</p>

<h4 id="have-any-errors-occurred-on-either-the-source-or-sink-cluster">Have any errors occurred on either the source or sink cluster?</h4>

<p>Errors experienced on either the source or sink cluster can result in
failure to replicate object(s) via realtime replication. The top-level
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rt_dirty</code> statistic in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riak-repl status</code> indicates whether such an
error has occurred and how many times. This statistic only tracks
errors and does not definitively indicate that an object was not
successfully replicated. For this reason, a fullsync should be performed
any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rt_dirty</code> is non-zero. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rt_dirty</code> is then reset to zero once a
fullsync successfully completes.</p>

<p>The size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rt_dirty</code> can quantify the number of errors that have
occurred and should be graphed. Since any non-zero value indicates an
error, an alert should be set so that a fullsync can be performed (if
not regularly scheduled). Like realtime queue back ups, trends in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rt_dirty</code> can reveal problems with the network, system, or Riak.</p>

<h4 id="have-any-objects-been-dropped-from-the-realtime-queue">Have any objects been dropped from the realtime queue?</h4>

<p>The realtime replication queue will drop objects when the queue is full,
with the dropped object(s) being the last (oldest) in the queue. Each
time an object is dropped, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drops</code> statistic, which can be found
under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">realtime_queue_stats</code> section of the replication status
output, is incremented. An object dropped from the queue has not been
replicated successfully, and a fullsync should be performed when a drop
occurs. A dropped object can indicate a halt or delay in replication or
indicate that the realtime queue is overloaded. In cases of high load,
increases to the maximum size of the queue (displayed in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">realtime_queue_stats</code> section of the replication status output as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_bytes</code>) can be made to accommodate a usage pattern of expected high
load.</p>

<hr />

<p>Although the above statistics have been highlighted to answer specific
questions, other statistics can also be helpful in diagnosing issues
with realtime replication. We recommend graphing any statistic that is
reported as a number. While their values and trends may not answer
common questions or those we’ve highlighted here, they may nonetheless
be important when investigating issues in the future. Other questions
that cannot be answered through statistics alone may be addressed
through the use of canary objects.</p>

<h3 id="canary-objects">Canary Objects</h3>

<p>Canary object testing is a technique that uses a test object stored in
your environment with your production data but not used or modified by
your application. This allows the test object to have predictable states
and to be used to answer questions about the functionality and duration
of realtime replication.</p>

<p>The general process for using canary objects to test realtime replication is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perform a GET for your canary object on both your source and sink
clusters, noting their states. The state of the object in each cluster
can be referred to as state <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S0</code>, or the object’s initial state.</li>
  <li>PUT an update for your canary object to the source cluster, updating
the state of the object to the next state, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S1</code>.</li>
  <li>Perform a GET for your canary on the sink cluster, comparing the state
of the object on the source cluster to the state of the object on the
sink cluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>By expanding upon the general process above, the following questions can
be answered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a backed-up realtime replication queue still replicating objects
within a defined SLA?</li>
  <li>How long is it taking for objects to be replicated from the source
cluster to the sink cluster?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-a-backed-up-realtime-replication-queue-still-replicating-objects-within-a-defined-sla">Is a backed-up realtime replication queue still replicating objects within a defined SLA?</h4>

<p>Building on the final step of the general process, we can determine if
our objects are being replicated from the source cluster to the sink
cluster within a certain SLA time period by adding the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the state of the object on the source cluster is not equal to the
state of the object on the sink cluster, repeat step 3 until an SLA
time threshold is exceeded.</li>
  <li>If the SLA time threshold is exceeded, alert that replication is not
meeting the necessary SLA.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-long-is-it-taking-for-objects-to-be-replicated-from-the-source-cluster-to-the-sink-cluster">How long is it taking for objects to be replicated from the source cluster to the sink cluster?</h4>

<p>Getting a rough estimate of how long it takes an object PUT to a source
cluster to be replicated to a sink cluster get be done by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comparing the time the object was PUT to the source with the time the
states of the object in the source and sink were equivalent</li>
  <li>Comparing the timestamps of the object on the source and sink when the
states are equivalent</li>
</ul>

<p>These are rough estimates, as neither method is 100% accurate. The first
method relies on a timestamp for a GET and subsequent successful
comparison, which means that the object was replicated prior to that
timestamp; the second method relies on the system clocks of two
different machines, which may not be in sync.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that each node in a cluster has its own realtime
replication queue. The general process needs to be applied to every
node in the source cluster, with a variety of canary objects and states,
to get a complete picture of realtime replication between two clusters.</p>
